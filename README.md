# Implementing insertion sort in Python, Julia, Rust

In this lab, you will need to implement one of the simplest sorting algorithms - insertion sort in Python, Julia, and Rust.

Here is the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) for insertion sort, and here is a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU767SDMDvA) video explaining the algorithm.

There will be 3 parts to this lab, which are Python, Julia, and Rust. You are recommended to go through the 3 parts in this order.
